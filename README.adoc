= GraphRAG Fundamentals training course

A hands-on online training course for learning GraphRAG. Hosted for Pearson through O'Reilly media.

== Overview

This repository contains a completed solution for implementing GraphRAG with a variety of different approaches:

- manual GraphRAG: assembling vector search + graph retrieval
- Spring advisors: out-of-the-box, yet customizable, approaches to RAG
- agents: allowing LLM to decide best function(s) for each question

Technologies used include:

- Spring AI Java framework (Langchain4j also an alternative)
- Neo4j graph database
- OpenAI model (text-embedding-ada-002)

== Requirements

In order to run the application, you will need the following things:

1. OpenAI key (temporary key is granted by presenter during live course)
2. Java 17 or higher
3. Maven

== Data and data model

A Neo4j database is set up with data pre-loaded for you to use. You are welcome to connect to this public, read-only instance or configure your own. The data schema for this instance is shown below. Though not every entity is defined in our application, the domain classes are enough to explore for this course.

Feel free to add entities or change things for further development later on!

== Environment setup

1. Rename the `src/main/resources/exampleEnv.sh` script to `env.sh`:
```
cp src/main/resources/exampleEnv.sh src/main/resources/env.sh
```
2. OpenAI API Key: Set your OpenAI API key in the copied `env.sh` script:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
3. Run the `env.sh` to set your environment:
```
source ./env.sh
```

== Running the application

Set environment variable (if applicable) for Large Language Model - e.g. Open AI.

[source,shell]
----
source ./env.sh
----

Run the application.

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Test the endpoints.
